# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to create a business proposal using Tableau to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is viable. 

For the analysis the following visualizations were created:

- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

The bar chart below shows the average peak hours during summertime, which are mainly before work at 8am and after work from 5 to 7pm. Riders are mainly using the convience of citibikes to commute to work and to possibly exercise after work

The most popular starting points are in the center of the city where parking and driving tend to be more hectic. Citibikes are the most convenient solution for both locals and tourists to move around that area

Two additional visualizations for future analysis:
- Users brokendown by age and their number of rides for each hour of each day of the week
- Include additional demographic data (income, employment, marital status etc) and analyze their citibike usage
